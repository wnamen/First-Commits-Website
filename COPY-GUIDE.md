# First Commits Copy Guide

A language reference for website copy. These are surgical swaps to maintain a grounded, community-first tone.

---

## Core Positioning

First Commits is a private community for early operators—the people who build companies from zero. We're focused on building community and holding events, not operating as a talent marketplace.

**We are:**
- A community of shared experience
- Early-stage focused
- Event and gathering-driven

**We are not:**
- A talent pipeline
- A marketplace
- A placement service

## Global Language Swaps

### Avoid → Prefer

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| Talent layer | Founding operators |
| Access to operators | Early builders |
| Elite talent network | People who were there at the beginning |
| Top startup talent | Operators who've shipped, scaled, and stayed |
| Pipeline | Community |
| Placement | — |

## Page-Specific Copy

### Home Page

**Avoid:**
> "A private community for top startup talent."

**Prefer:**
> "A private community for the first people who build companies."

or

> "A private space for early operators shaping companies from zero."

*Grounds the promise in stage, not status.*

---

### Hero Section

Use recognition-based language. Short lines. Sparse. Let the reader self-identify.

**Preferred lines:**
- "Built for those who joined early."
- "For the people behind the first commits."
- "Before the org chart. Before the hype."

---

### Events & Community

Premium communities don't host events; they convene.

**Avoid:**
- Curated events
- Programming
- Workshops and panels

**Prefer:**
- Small, intentional gatherings
- Closed-door conversations
- Operator-led dinners and working sessions

---

### Apply Page

Frame it as a signal, not a transaction.

**Avoid:**
> "Apply to become a member of First Commits."

**Prefer:**
> "Request an introduction."

or

> "Signal interest."

**Follow with:**
> "Membership is referral-based and intentionally limited."

*No gatekeeping theatrics. Just calm boundaries.*

---

### Application Form Questions

**Avoid:**
> "Why do you want to join?"

**Prefer:**
> "What have you built or operated at an early stage?"

or

> "Where did you join before it was obvious?"

*Reinforces values without preaching them.*

---

### Partner Page

Frame partnerships as alignment, not leverage.

**Avoid:**
- Strategic talent access
- Pipeline
- Placement

**Prefer:**
- A trusted operator community
- A place your early hires already gather
- A way to support the people building inside your portfolio

---

### About Page

Keep it grounded. Avoid mythology.

**Avoid:**
> "We're redefining how startups connect with talent."

**Prefer:**
> "First Commits started as a way for early hires to find each other."

**Then build forward:**
> "What emerged was a community built on shared context, trust, and proximity to the work."

*Reads confident because it's honest.*

---

## Tone Principles

1. **Stage over status** — Focus on when people joined, not their titles
2. **Recognition over declaration** — Let readers self-identify
3. **Grounded over grandiose** — Honest is more confident than mythological
4. **Calm boundaries** — State limits without theatrics
5. **Convene, don't program** — Gatherings, not content
